The standard is divided into 10 sections, which cover the following topics:

Question: explain iso
Answer: ISO 13485 is an international standard that sets out the requirements for a quality management system (QMS) for the medical devices industry. It is intended to help organizations in the medical devices industry to consistently provide medical devices that meet customer and regulatory requirements.

ISO 13485 is based on the ISO 9001 standard, which is a generic QMS standard that can be used by organizations in any industry. However, ISO 13485 includes additional requirements that are specific to the medical devices industry, such as requirements for risk management, design and development, production and service, and post-market surveillance.

ISO 13485 is a voluntary standard, but it is often required by regulatory authorities in many countries. It is also a valuable tool for organizations in the medical devices industry to improve their quality management systems and to ensure that they are consistently producing safe and effective medical devices.
